        "pages/[languageId]/story/firstMeet": "🇺🇦 Our story began in 2017, when we first met other through common friends in the lovely city of Turku. At the time, Viktoriia had just returned from her student exchange semester in Slovenia, juggling between an internship and her master thesis, and Victor had just moved to the city, pursuing his PhD degree after an unforgettable student exchange the previous year. We began to hang out in the company of common friends, and soon enough the harsh and dark Finnish autumn and winter seasons also started their part in bringing us closer together. After endless sessions of \"Settlers of Catan\" and other board games, we ended up talking more and more on all kinds of topics, including many exchanges of \"Friends\" quotes and references, until, eventually, sometime in April, we went on our first date together. And this is how Vappu, or the 1st of May, has become also our very own reason of celebration - the anniversary of us! 🇺🇦",
        "pages/[languageId]/story/lifeTogether": "🇺🇦 The time moved quickly afterwards, with our own little corner of life, spending time together at home or travelling together far and wide! A lot of things happened, from new jobs to graduations, from internships abroad to world pandemics and war. It was a time of many months spent physically apart, but not in spirit, with almost daily calls, chats, virtual board games, and synchronized streaming. Once the world started breathing more easily once more, we found ourselves picking up right were we left off, and, with a surprise proposal three winters ago, we got engaged! 🇺🇦",
